*EPIC*: A new code to measure stellar parameters of Sun like stars
==================================================================
Python Version 3.7.4 or later.
The EPIC algorithm was created to analyse spectra from the HERMES spectrograph effectively and efficiently. It calculates equivalent widths (EWs) for lines found within a line list (default Master_ll) and uses a sub-group of these lines in order to calculate stellar parameters (effective temperature T_eff, surface gravity log(g) and metallicity [Fe/H]). The whole process of the algorithm was explained in detail in Lehmann et al. (2022).

Precision of EPIC
=================
The main advantage of EPIC is the increase of precision/decrease of uncertainties for stellar parameters. The following diagram shows EPIC measured uncertainties (blue dots) with the median measured uncertainty displayed (orange line). For a better comparison, the red dashed line displays the median uncertainties of The Cannon, the algorithm used by the GALAH survey in their second data release.

Preparation of spectra
======================
The functionality of this script is explained in Section 2.1 of Lehmann et al. (2022).
Every spectrum that EPIC may be applied to should be prepared with the EPIC_prep.py algorithm. This algorithm can handle spectra from the GALAH DR3 (accessible at https://datacentral.org.au/services/download/) and spectra from the HARPS instrument found on the ESO database (http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_spectral/form). 

Usage
-----
Within a Python environment with the required dependencies, EPIC_prep.py can simply be executed via the command line, example:

  $ python3 EPIC_prep.py --HERMES example_spectra/1705090042013241.fits             # for HERMES spectra. Note the --HERMES option
  $ python3 EPIC_prep.py example_spectra/ADP.2014-10-01T10\:19\:57.023.fits         # for HARPS spectra

It will also accept multiple inputs, i.e.:

  $ python3 EPIC_prep.py --HERMES example_spectra/1705090042013241.fits 1705090042013242.fits   # or
  $ python3 EPIC_prep.py --HERMES example_spectra/170509004201324*                              # (wildcard under Linux)

It will return the prepared spectrum under the name

  $ Norm_{initial file name}(1-4).fits                            # for HERMES spectra
  $ HERMES_{star name as found in the HARPS header}(1-3).fits     # for HARPS spectra

These files can be used in the EPIC main program.

*EPIC* main algorithm
=====================
The functionality of the main algorithm is explained in Section 2.1 of Lehmann et al. (2022).
It can be applied to any input spectrum that has been prepared with the EPIC_prep.py script.

Usage
-----
EPIC is simply used via the command line and at the minimum requires two arguments: The reference spectrum (without the x.fits extension) and at least one target spectrum.

  $ python3 EPIC.py (Options) [1.reference / 2.target HERMES]

Example usage
-------------

  $ python3 EPIC.py Reference_spectrum/HERMES_Kurucz example_spectra/Norm_1706150044012332.fits

Note that EPIC will search for the endings 1.fits, 2.fits, 3.fits and 4.fits (for each band of HERMES) itself when one of them is entered.
One might be interested in analysing all spectra within a folder, simply insert them all as the last arguments or use a wildcard command:

  $ python3 EPIC.py Reference_spectrum/HERMES_Kurucz example_spectra/Norm*2.fits

Options
-------
EPIC has several option that might be needed in different situations:

  -a, --air_corr: The spectrum is in air wavelength and therefore will need to be corrected to a vacuum wavelength scale (using the Edlen 1953 formula).


  -e, --err [exptime] [vmag]: Add noise to the target spectrum by giving exposure time(s), mag of V band and base noise. The noise in each band is calculated using solar relations between the bands, e.g. the red band has r_mag = v_mag - 0.352


  -h, --harps: The target spectra are spectra taken with HARPS and simulated to HERMES resolution.


  -s, --self: Simplify the calculations within EPIC when using the reference spectrum as a target spectrum (comparing it against itself). 


  --SNR [SNR_b] [SNR_v] [SNR_r] [SNR_ir]: Add noise to the the spectrum's flux and modify the error array accordingly via a specific signal-to-noise ratio for each band. The SNRs must be given in the order blue band SNR (spectrum ending in 1.fits), green band SNR (spectrum ending in 2.fits), red band SNR (spectrum ending in 3.fits) and infrared band SNR (spectrum ending in 4.fits).


  --SNR_err_only [SNR_b] [SNR_v] [SNR_r] [SNR_ir]: Similar process as in the above command, but only modifies the error array and leaves the flux array untouched. This is to give high SNR spectra (e.g. the solar atlas) a realistic error array that makes it better comparable with real HERMES spectra. in the calibrations we used --SNR_err_only 50 50 50 50 for all HARPS spectra and the solar atlas.


Output
------
Each of these files can be read in via Topcat using the Ascii input option.

  Li_line.dat: A file that gathers the EW of the Li line at 6707.76 Angstrom. It displays the EW for bother the reference and target spectrum as well as their uncertainties. EPIC will add to this file for each spectrum that is analysed to give a statistic for the Li lines.
  Note that this is a weak and not very stable line, so most low SNR spectra will not measure a reasonable value here. It is only interesting to measure this line when the Li content in a star is high.


  EW.dat.gz file: A gziped file that contains the EW width measurements of all lines within the line list that was given to EPIC. Each spectrum will have a new file that saves all their respective EW values. Displays EW for both the target and reference spectrum as well as their difference and uncertainties.
Note that not all lines are used to measure the EW, but all lines will have an EW measurement if the measurement can be done successfully.


  rv_statistics.dat: A file collecting the radial velocity that has been calculated for each band. If the radial velocity correction has been applied correctly, each of these numbers should be within 5km/s (~1 pixel) of each other.


  stellar_params.dat: A file containing the three stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) as well as their uncertainties. In addition there is the average radial velocity between the 4 bands and a radial velocity flag showing if all the radial velocities have been computed correctly (e.g. FFFF is a no band failed with the correction, FTTF means that the V and R band failed their radial velocity correction). Lastly there is the Resolving power reduction which is not implemented completely, yet.


  stellar_params_no_casali.dat: The same as stellar_params.dat but the stellar parameters are computed without the higher-order correction that uses the Casali et al. (2020) data. See Lehmann et al. (2022).
